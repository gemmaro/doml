As it has overridable in its name, you can define and <em>modify</em> markup definitions for any documents.
        </p>
        <p>
            A DOML document consists of a preamble definition and content.
Preamble definition and content are separated by a blank line.
The content consists of multiple definitions or blocks.

(# DOML - Document Overridable Markup Language #)

DOML is one of the structural and lightweight markup language for document.
As it has overridable in its name, you can define and (*modify*) markup definitions for any documents.</code></pre>
        <p>
            The definition section defines the block or inline syntax.
Block or inline syntax is defined as the following format in one line.
        </p>
        <pre><code><i>left-tag</i> <i>right-tag</i>: <i>category</i></code></pre>
        <p>
            Tag notation must be symmetric.
Only ASCII characters may be used.
In particular, the outermost character must be the one that has a symmetric pair.
That is: <code>( )</code>, <code>{ }</code>, <code>[ ]</code>, and <code>&lt; &gt;</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Category defines the meaning given to tags.
The category set and any meaning or interpretation is up to the processor and is not defined in this document.
        </p>
        <p>
            Definition can be overridden in the middle of the document.
You must define the syntax for the definition in the preamble.
        </p>
        <pre><code>(``` ```): code-block
[! !]: definitions

(```
print "Hello, "
```)

[!
{{{ }}}: code-block
!]

{{{
puts "world!"
}}}</code></pre>
